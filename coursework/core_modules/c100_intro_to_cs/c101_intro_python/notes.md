## Lecture 1: Introduction

Computational/Algorithmic thinking:

Aim: Think like a computer scientist
How can a computer solve the problem?

- Use simple operations and turn them into something more powerful
- Time taken to complete a computation and size of data are hard limitations that prevent brute forcing being a feasible solution to every problem

*NB* Turing Halting Problem:

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)
>In computability theory, the halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running (i.e., halt) or continue to run forever.
